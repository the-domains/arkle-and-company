This has not been down to chance but is the consequence of a conscious decision to focus on the human behaviours associated with success in large offshore Projects.</p><p>Many organisations aspire to this goal but often fall short.</p><p>This paper outlines the philosophy adopted on Cetus and explains how the outstanding results to 31st December 2015 are directly correlated with the investment in human capital.</p><p><strong>46 days ahead of annual AFE (</strong>23rd May to 31st Dec 2015) a saving of £17m in this period.</p><p><strong>£143m identified saving through engineering simplification – circa 15% with an expected additional 5% saving year on year of the project.</strong></p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>This paper is written using fictitious names – Cetus, Perseus and Poseidon.</p><p><em>Cetus is the Oil Field,</em></p><p><em>Perseus is the Operator, and</em></p><p><em>Poseidon is the Drilling Contractors rig.</em></p><p>Other than this everything in this paper actually happened and the results are real and can be substantiated.</p><p><strong>Development of the Organisational Structure</strong></p><p>The structure of a project of the scale of Cetus is vitally important.</p><p>Whether it is organised around existing business functions and units or is set up as a completely separate and self-supporting structure with minimal links to back-office functions, the focus needs to be on transparency and simplicity. There are arguments for both types of organisational structure.</p><p>In all organisations there are barriers to progress for one reason or another.</p><p>Often these are due to the availability of those from the wider organisation who ‘need’ to be involved, the lack of a common understanding of what has, is and needs to happen and what the short and long term implications of their decisions are.</p><p>Equally there is an argument that by having people from outside of the day to day grind there can be benefits.</p><p>However in such a fast moving, 24hr a day, project environment this knowledge is best leveraged as an off-line exercise.</p><p>A project in its own right, that needs to move quickly, learn as fast and make decisions without any hindrance of time and that can draw on the opinion of the local knowledge and technical experts, is often suited to a more separate and independent structure.</p><p>This was the case in Cetus as the onshore engineers, the offshore management team and technical experts formed the critical mass of local knowledge and expertise.</p><p>With this specific cohort of people the project is able to make decisions, learn and capture the outcomes and disseminate these across all directly involved in the project as soon as it needs to.</p><p>The Cetus Project is therefore somewhat removed from the business and only leverages back-office function of IT, HR and Finance. This structure has been fundamental to the success of the project to date. It does not come without some wider organisational issues but it does underwrite the responsiveness and agility of the project.</p><p>When the Cetus Project was first formed it was simply a few engineers and the Development Manager.</p><p>As the scope was defined and the elements of the project sanctioned more and more people were recruited to the project.</p><p>As it stands today there are two distinct parts:</p><ol><li>The construction of the FPSO; and</li><li>Subsurface infrastructure and the Drilling, Completions and Subsea</li></ol><p>This paper mainly concerns itself with Drilling, Completions and Subsea. There are, of course, many links with the Subsurface Team and the Development Manager oversees the entirety of the project.</p><p>Once the project was sanctioned, in late 2013, the team required to deliver the Wells needed to expand.</p><p>As recently as February 2015 all Team Leads reported directly to the Development Manager and as more and more contracts were brought online the understanding and management of these needed to be made explicit.</p><p>(As an indication of the importance of the relationships within Cetus it was decided very early on to use the term Specialist Team Member (STM) rather than ‘third party’ or similar.</p><p>This nuance of language reflects the level of detail given to the human aspect of the Project and also signposts the critical importance of the relationships of all Project members).</p><p>It was a classic case of ‘organic’ growth.</p><p>As the project grew, people, by default, found themselves in positions of managing people, managing relationships with STMs as well as their day-jobs. This is only sustainable to a point and the common understanding of a small project team quickly loses its edge and the benefit of all sitting around one desk.</p><p>In the latter part of 2014 a Drilling Superintendent <em>[Barry Fraser] </em>was appointed to take charge of the Drilling, Completions and Subsea areas of the project. The Superintendent reports directly to the Development Manager and is the focal point and line manager for all the technical team leads, their teams and the relationships with external STMs, both on and offshore.</p><p>This visibility of lines of reporting is critical to the success of a project and also provides everyone with the certainty of who to go to.</p><p>As projects grow it is typical to spend most of the time and energy in search of the competitive advantage, defining strategy, identifying cost savings, better technology and more sophisticated engineering.</p><p>All of this is smart.</p><h2>However there is one critical advantage that is available to any project of the scale of Cetus, wishing to invest the time and effort to get it, and that is ‘Organisational Health’ [1]</h2><p>This is often largely ignored or paid lip service to but is the primary lever that enables and often creates a paradigm shift for the ‘smart’ behaviours outlined above.</p><p>To help facilitate this change and to link the people aspects of the project with the technical, a Change Management and engagement specialist <em>[I. Menmuir] </em>was recruited in February 2015 with a dual role of HSEA offshore. This was the primary catalyst for achieving a ’healthy organisation’.</p><p>The Drilling Superintendent and the Change Management Lead defined what needed to happen to make sure the project was in the fittest state possible to embark on such a testing campaign.</p><p>During the build up to the spud date the project was reorganised to provide the aforementioned clarity on and offshore. The aim was to achieve and maintain consistency.</p><p>A big goal, which requires enormous effort, is to trust in one another and within the leadership team in particular. In the most part this is invisible.</p><p>The four discipline process of a ‘Healthy Organisation’ was used as a guide and to help us deliver the required healthy project structure and achieve the principles of Trust, Transparency, Simplification and Change.</p><p>This is only achieved through the people.</p><p><strong>People Complexity</strong></p><p><strong>Overview:</strong></p><p>An observation in so many companies is the amount of unnecessary duplication either in the sense of two or more people doing the same work or duplication in systems – usually checking – because so few people have confidence or trust in their colleagues’ work or the systems that are in place. This can be very expensive. There is a fine balance to be struck because each project is different. Therefore, systems must be robust but flexible enough to cope with individuality. All those using the tools must be able to trust them and one another.</p><p>Whenever people are introduced into a project its complexity escalates exponentially.</p><p>All drilling campaigns have challenges around people, many of whom have never met or worked together.</p><p>The multitude of different companies coming together but with different modus-operandi has seen some staggering issues, mostly due to little or no effort in engaging them with the collective goal and focusing solely on targets and engineering – the tangible stuff!</p><p><em>A healthy organisation benefits from:</em></p><p><em>Less confusion &amp; duplication</em></p><p><em>Higher morale &amp; productivity</em></p><p><em>Higher confidence &amp; trust amongst colleagues &amp; in systems</em></p><p><em>Robust but flexible systems</em></p><p>The power of these qualities is not easily disputed. Unfortunately most projects and companies struggle to make this happen.</p><p>The first step is to embrace the idea that, like so many other aspects of success, having a healthy organisation is simple in theory BUT difficult in practice. It requires <strong>exceptional commitment, courage and consistency</strong>. It does not require complex thinking or analysis as keeping things simple is critical.</p><p>The second step is to master the four fundamental disciplines of a healthy organisation: build and maintain a cohesive leadership team; create clarity; over-communicate clarity; and reinforce clarity through human systems, then put them into practice every day.</p><p><strong>People Background:</strong></p><p>During the course of Q4 of 2014 Perseus signed the Poseidon, a Semi-Submersible Cyber Rig, for the 4 year campaign on the Cetus Field. The rig had been working in Norway for the previous 10 years and was due into the shipyard for a large scale maintenance programme.</p><p>With the rig market starting to show a significant down-turn and with many crews being laid-off you would think Perseus and the Poseidon had the pick of the bunch. Simply we did. But it came with bigger challenges than expected, particularly that the crew who knew the rig inside-out were not coming with it to the UKCS.</p><p>We were faced with a brand new crew coming to a rig that they did not know and many of who had little or no Cyber experience. Much of the equipment and many of the systems on the rig would be new to everyone. It was not just as simple as selecting an entire crew from another similar rig and moving them across.</p><p>As different rigs came off contract, the crews were assessed and then selected for the Poseidon by the Rig and Operation Managers and the OIMs – who also had not worked together or on the Poseidon. The focus was particularly on the competence of the individual and how they would ‘fit’ with the emerging crew. Over a 3-4 month period the crew started to take shape.</p><p>There were small groups of people that had worked together but in all the 120 members of the crew came from 5 or 6 different rigs, had never met and had not worked together.</p><p>Three possible challenges of this situation were identified:</p><p><em>1. The small groups that had worked together could form into an even tighter, closed group bringing a legacy of what had gone before on their previous rig. Many of these individuals had been on their previous rig for 10 years or more.</em></p><p><em>2. How to mitigate point 1, integrate new, unknown people into the team and mix up the small groups.</em></p><p><em>3. People joining the crew having taken a ‘demotion’ and how best to manage them?</em></p><p>Then there was the problem of knowledge transfer, and time needed to gain experience, of the rig from the existing Norwegian crew across all the new UK crew members.</p><p>It was decided that as many of the UK crew would join while the rig was in the shipyard in Norway, working alongside the Norwegian crew.</p><p>A limited number of the Norwegian crew would also come into the UKCS for up to 6 months as well to work alongside the UK crew on actual operations.</p><p>This posed further challenges!</p><p><em>1. How do you keep the Norwegian crew motivated when they knew within 4-6 months their contract would end and the likelihood, given the rapidly declining market conditions, they would not have another rig to go to?</em></p><p><em>2. Management and Supervisory positions now had multiple people in the same position of authority but with vastly differing levels of experience of the rig.</em></p><p><em>Who do you actually turn to for advice and leadership?</em></p><p><em>3. How and when do you actually know the UK crew have received all the benefit and knowledge from their Norwegian counterparts?</em></p><p>Then we introduced new team members to the onshore team and the STMs.</p><p>The latter who are used to working frequently with different crews and different rigs but none of them had worked on a rig with a brand new crew who are learning the ins and outs of the rig as fast as they are.</p><p>So, to set out and mitigate as much of this as possible is where the ‘Organisational Health’ model really comes into play. In addition the visible commitment from the Drilling Superintendent and the Cetus leadership team and the input of a dedicated Change Management specialist ensured that the aspirations had a high probability of being turned into the sought after best in class results.</p><p><strong>1. Develop and Maintain a Cohesive Leadership Team:</strong></p><p><strong>Outcome: </strong>Established the foundations of the leadership team that: Trusts one another, is transparent, strives for simplification and embraces change.</p><p>Very few groups of leaders actually work as a team that lead a healthy organisation; they are more of a <em>“Working Group”[</em>2<em>]</em>. To become a real team is an intentional decision by all in the ‘group’, it is not a given.</p><p>It is a strategic choice and requires more work and sacrifices for the common good of the team and not just the individual’s portfolio of responsibility. Before this choice could be made such a group needs to understand and agree on a common purpose and modus-operandi of what a leadership team really is.</p><p>The success of this process starts to establish the cohesiveness of the team.</p><p>In aligning the team and starting to build trust and collective responsibility these are the core elements you have to address:</p><p><em>Build trust &amp; unity</em></p><p><em>Eliminate silos &amp; turf-wars</em></p><p><em>Increase efficiency &amp; purpose</em></p><p><em>Explore &amp; exploit diversity of each of the team</em></p><p><em>Establish common understanding</em></p><p><em>Create Organisational clarity [3]</em></p><p>A highly effective team has these attributes:</p><p><em>1. </em>They <em>trust </em>one another</p><p><em>2. </em>It engages in formative <em>conflict </em>as a matter of course</p><p><em>3. </em>It <em>commits </em>to decisions and action</p><p><em>4. </em>It holds each other <em>accountable </em>for their actions and behaviours</p><p><em>5. </em>It focuses collectively on <em>results</em>. <em>[3]</em></p><p>All this is easily said and we often convince ourselves that we are good at it.</p><p>When we peel back the surface of any team it doesn’t take long to identify many areas where we cannot really claim the ‘excellence’ and team-working we profess to have!</p><p>In the case of the Cetus Offshore Leadership Team we were able to take advantage of one fundamental thing that could have worked against us. That we did not really know each other and we had not worked together before.</p><p>This team consists of the onshore Poseidon Rig and Asset Managers, Perseus Drilling Superintendent and the offshore team of the Offshore Installation Manager (OIM), Senior Drilling Supervisors (SDSV), Night Drilling Supervisors (NDSV), Senior Toolpushers (STP) and Change Management / Health, Safety and Environment Advisors (HSEA).</p><p>The offshore positions work on an equal time rota so there are two people in each position. For those outside of the industry having two people in each role is mind-boggling but something we take for granted. Again this affords us a peculiar benefit – we have to have faith in our back-to-back and find mutual ground on how we operate.</p><p>From the outside this seems impossible.</p><p>So, this team was brought together well ahead of leaving the shipyard in Norway and the crew was still in its infancy.</p><p>The programme to facilitate the Leadership Alignment was designed by the Change Management Lead / HSEA and an external facilitator who also ran the actual workshop to ensure everyone in the team would be involved.</p><p>The purpose of this Leadership Alignment session was to understand and agree on a common purpose and modus-operandi but also get to know one another, share some of our experience, discuss how and what we collectively felt made a cohesive leadership team and set out expectations of each other, of the crew and what they could expect from us.</p><p>This process is not necessarily new to Drilling Campaigns. However what was particularly unusual was the almost exclusive focus on the people aspect of the project and how it has been followed through. Also, how every member of the team showed remarkable vulnerability to one another around the things they needed help with as a leader rather than diluting their weaknesses. This vulnerability is critical.</p><p>It starts the process of establishing Trust.</p><p>It also gave us the platform to create clarity in what expectations we had of one another, what we expect of others and what others can expect of the whole leadership team.</p><p>Part of the success of this process is that each person does not carry their Company ‘mantra’ but instead made the choice, perhaps the most important strategic choice, to engage with each other, understand everyone’s point of view and commit to this team and what we decide we stand for.</p><p><strong>2. Create Organisational Clarity:</strong></p><p><strong>Outcome: </strong>An agile and evolving ‘organisation’ equipped and able to maximise opportunities.</p><p>All of this effort is captured and consolidated into the Cetus Team Leader Charter of Interdependence, (a copy can be found in the Appendix) which is the key tenet of clarity.</p><p>It answers:</p><p>1. Why we (the Leadership Team and Crews) exist</p><p>2. How we are unique &amp; what we stand for</p><p>3. Which behavioural values are fundamental</p><p>4. What it plans to achieve and sets expectations</p><p>This Charter is clear and simple.</p><p>It goes a long way in achieving alignment and in its design to be inclusive throughout the offshore crews.</p><p>Having such a mechanism and the alignment it creates is critical given the number and variety of people involved and the rate at which people come and go from the operations offshore.</p><p>It also provides the framework off which everything else hangs and the ‘sense-check’ in avoiding the three main areas in which teams fail:</p><p><em><strong>Sunk Cost Effect -</strong></em></p><p><em>The tendency for people to escalate commitment to a course of action in which they have made substantial prior investments of time, money, or other resources.</em></p><p><em><strong>Over confidence bias -</strong></em></p><p><em>The tendency to have overly confident self-assessments.</em></p><p><em><strong>Recency Effect -</strong></em></p><p><em>The tendency to place too much emphasis on information and evidence that is readily available, such as recent events.</em></p><p>Avoiding these is best achieved by giving people the space and time to learn and fully understand first before carrying out the task.</p><p>And by having a rig that is fastidious in learning through developing its people and continuous improvement in every operational task we do.</p><p>This means we can change quickly and turn challenges into opportunities.</p><p>The offshore organisational structure we adopted to achieve this is somewhat different from what is considered ‘normal’ and in particular three specific roles.</p><p>Two of the roles are in Perseus, the Health, Safety and Environmental Advisor (HSEA) and the Continuous Improvement Coach (CIP) and one within Transocean the Performance Toolpusher.</p><p>In simple terms these three roles take off a lot of the weight from the SDSV, OIM and Senior Toolpusher to give them additional space to focus on the overall operations.</p><p>The role of the HSEA includes and goes a long way beyond the obvious.</p><p>It is ‘behavioural safety’ in its widest context at both the individual and organisation level. Support of the onshore and offshore leadership teams in their decision–making, people management and continued focus on the stated objectives of the Charter facilitates the ‘organisational health’ of the project and of course indirectly promotes safe performance.</p><p>Acting as a coach and mentor to the whole crew as they require it is also a key role of the HSEA and is critical in fostering a healthy organisation. Managing and supporting change by maintaining transparency regardless of ‘company’ is instrumental.</p><p><strong>3. Over Communicate Organisational Clarity:</strong></p><p><strong>Outcome: </strong>Crew Engagement - communicating simple, easily understood messages and goals. Involve and listen to everyone. Expect change and learn.</p><p>Now that the Leadership has made the decision and is clear on its purpose, engaging with the rest of the ‘organisation’ is relatively straight forward.</p><p>Well, as straight-forward as it can be when there are over 200 people from over 20 different companies and we want to listen to and give clarity to every single one of them!</p><p>This was achieved through two separate, yet identical in the most part, off-site Crew Engagement and Drilling the Well on Paper (DWOP) workshops held prior to the rig arriving on location.</p><p>The format for these has evolved over the last 5 years to become highly effective.</p><p>The Drilling Superintendent and Change Management / HSEA being instrumental in the evolution of and the design supported by the same external facilitator who ran the Leadership Alignment.</p><p>This continuity is important and provides depth and credibility.</p><p>This format followed directly on from the Leadership Alignment.</p><p>1. Getting to know each other, face to face, has value that is hard to define but delivers stronger, more trusting relationship and exponential results as a consequence.</p><p>2. Having some fun! One of the most effective ways to form relationships.</p><p>3. Common Understanding across the whole project, technical specialists and setting expectations.</p><p>4. Involving everyone in the entire drilling programme and seeking their particular specialist view, what changes should be made and how we could do better.</p><p>5. Listening to what the entire crew expect of the Leadership Team.</p><p>6. Asking each individual to write a simple commitment to everyone else.</p><p>This format involves everyone, provides many opportunities to voice their ideas and thoughts and hear others. It truly engages people with the project and establishes relationships formally and informally.</p><p>Elements of this are still mentioned a year after the events.</p><p><strong>4. Reinforce Organisational Clarity Through Human Systems:</strong></p><p>1. Hiring</p><p>2. Induction and safety</p><p>3. Managing performance</p><p>4. Continuous improvement</p><p>5. Learning</p><p>6. Rewards &amp; recognition</p><p>7. Employee dismissal!</p><p><strong>Reality Offshore</strong></p><p>If everyone is happy, competent and suitably confident in what they are doing then everything else will follow…</p><p>1. Hiring:</p><p>Primarily based on two things.</p><p>Firstly their competency, capability and suitability for the specific position and secondly how their character traits fit with the team.</p><p>People inevitably move on to other things and new people are introduced to the existing team.</p><p>The same principles are adopted but equally important is how the team engage and introduce the new team member into the rest of the team.</p><p>We use the ‘Cetus Team Leader’ Charter as the framework for this, in particular Respect and Care.</p><p>2. Induction and Safety:</p><p>The induction offshore is focused on what they need to know as a basis for having a happy and safe time on-board the Leader by engaging with the safety systems, meeting the expectations of the Leadership Team and how they can make their time onboard as enjoyable as possible.</p><p>Everyone is introduced to the Charter, respect and care are discussed specifically and everyone is asked to consider everyday:</p><p>What are the effects of me on me,</p><p>Me on others, and</p><p>Others on me.</p><p>This is important as we all have somewhat different views on how we do things, the risks involved and understand what is required.</p><p>3, 4 &amp; 5. Managing Performance, Continuous Improvement and Learning:</p><p>These three aspects are mostly managed in the Continuous Improvement Process.</p><p>This was designed and put into place from the outset and focuses heavily on engagement through common understand, confirming that understanding, simplifying things wherever possible, setting expectations and learning from one another.</p><p>The framework of this is the Planning Cycle:</p><p><em>Plan it – Talk with the right people,</em></p><p><em>Do it – Follow the plan,</em></p><p><em>Measure it – Was the plan good? and</em></p><p><em>Learn from it – capture the details and incorporate improvements in the plan for future operations.[</em>5<em>]</em></p><p>It does not necessarily measure performance against a theoretical best possible case as in <em>Drill the Limit [</em>6<em>]. </em>The Planning Cycle is focused on working together to get it right and safely. Performance and improving on that is one of the expectations of the process.</p><p>Where the implementation of this process is different is in allowing the right people the time and freedom to think and the focus on people.</p><p>Two particular actions take place:</p><p>Written Work Instructions (WWI):</p><p>These are multi-disciplinary meetings between offshore and onshore personnel to review the existing plan, discuss alternative methods and learning from previous experience and create a plan to safely carryout the specific operation.</p><p>This involves the key people from all disciplines in the particular operation.</p><p>Once the review of the WWI the draft is updated, checked, signed off and distributed to everyone involved with the specific operation.</p><p>After Operation Reviews (AOR):</p><p>Once the operation has been completed the same group of people involved with the WWI review the actual v’s expectations set out.</p><p>The lessons learnt are discussed and incorporated into the plan for the next occurrence of that operation.</p><p>To facilitate the WWI and AAR meetings dedicated video conferencing is used to bring the wider team as ‘close’ together as possible and benefit from real-time sharing and updating of the documents.</p><p>During the operations video cameras are widely used.</p><p>The footage is then made available and used in future WWI’s and Tool Box Talks (TBT’s) offshore.</p><p>This has been particularly important for sharing across crews in transferring learning for the first time and when the operation is of an unusual and infrequent nature.</p><p>It allows for a far better discussion and confirmation of understanding of all those who will be hands-on to carry out the specific tasks.</p><p>6. Reward and Recognition:</p><p>A process of regular review and acknowledgement of good performance and engagement is conducted by the Leadership Team.</p><p>This has already seen a number of rewards and the recognition of the whole team and individuals.</p><p>These are not linked to specific targets or goals.</p><p>They are linked to going beyond the expectations set out on an individual and collective level.</p><p>7. Employee dismissal:</p><p>Hopefully not!</p><p>However certain things are unacceptable and require disciplinary action.</p><p>This is set out in each of the separate companies HR Policies and procedures which is followed should the situation require it.</p><p>Offshore the expectations of being a part of the team are made clear and are simple by the OIM, SDSV and HSEA on everyone’s arrival.</p><p>At all times, everyone can come and discuss anything with the Leadership Team as they see fit.</p><p><strong>What’s different?</strong></p><p><strong>What is the impact?</strong></p><p>1. It is a good place to be. Comment is frequently passed by visitors to the rig how friendly and helpful everyone is.</p><p>2. People feel valued and respected through having a forum for their input to develop the instructions for operations long in advance of the task.</p><p>3. The two sides of the coin i.e. offshore and onshore are highly visible to each other breaking down any potential communication issues.</p><p>4. Operational difficulties are discussed and remedial actions agreed on and the operational successes are also captured and celebrated with the whole team present.</p><p>5. The STMs regularly comment on the willingness to help by all the Transocean personnel.</p><p>6. Alternative equipment and other avenues for operations are explored and implemented when deemed as reasonable in regards to improving safety and efficiency.</p><p>7. Without this each day can be a battle. We are in an industry that attracts strong personalities and conflict without reasonable accommodations on both sides leading to resolution is to be kept to an absolute minimum to ensure a highly productive operation.</p><p>8. We constantly try a new approach to resolving problems and bettering our performance to ‘get it right first time’ without any fear that it may not work. We do this by managing the weakest link and employing ‘professional speed’ – We do not chase after it.</p><p>9. Removing the pressure to ‘catch-up’ when things don’t go well has proven to put us ahead!</p><p>10. Our transparency has allowed everyone to engage in open and honest communication without reprimand.</p><p>This has been very beneficial to improving the way we work, the safety systems we employ, the procedures optimised and the conditions we live in get better.</p><p>11. Trusting in everyone to do their best everyday (actively not creating a pressured environment) delivers faster, safer and better results.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Trust, Transparency, Simplification and Change are easily said but very hard won.</p><p>The extent of the initial and on-going planning and execution of this whole process, the additional effort involved and commitment from everyone in particular the Leadership Team to make this effort everyday to keep the momentum up of focusing on people works.</p><p>I have spoken to so many Organisations, Departments, Teams and Projects all of whom say they have Trust and Transparency but quite quickly it appears to be different.</p><p>Few say they Simplify things but would really like too and all say Change is very tough. Those very few who do actually have Trust and Transparency find Simplification and Change relatively easy.</p><p><strong>Trust, Transparency, Simplification and Change delivers results:</strong></p><p><strong>46 days ahead of annual AFE </strong>(23rdMay to 31stDec 2015) a saving of £17m in this period.</p><p><strong>£143m identified saving through engineering simplification – circa 15% </strong>with an expected additional 5% saving year on year of the project.</p><p><strong>Appendix.</strong></p><p><em>A</em>Team as described by Katzenbach &amp; Smith:<em> “A team is a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals and an approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.”</em></p><p><em>1 The four obsessions of an extraordinary Executive - 2000, Patrick Lencioni,</em></p><p><em>2 </em>The Wisdom of Teams, Jon Katzenbach &amp; Douglas Smith. 1994</p><p><em>3 </em>The 5 Dysfucntions of a Team, Patrick Lencioni 2002</p><p><em>4 Fatal Ascent, Prof. Michael RobertoHBS 2003</em></p><p><em>5 Planning Cycle - Dr W.
